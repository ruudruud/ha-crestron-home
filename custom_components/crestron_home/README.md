4. Click "Add"
5. Search for "Crestron Home" in the HACS Integrations page
6. Click "Install"
7. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Getting an API Token

1. Open the Crestron Home Setup app
2. Go to Settings > System Settings > Web API
3. Enable the Web API
4. Generate a new API token
5. Copy the token for use in the integration setup

### Setting up the Integration

1. Go to Home Assistant > Settings > Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Search for "Crestron Home"
4. Enter the following information:
   - Host: The IP address or hostname of your Crestron Home processor
   - API Token: The token you generated in the Crestron Home Setup app
   - Update Interval: How often to poll for updates (in seconds)
   - Device Types to Include: Select which types of devices to include (lights, shades, scenes)

## Usage

Once configured, your Crestron Home devices will appear in Home Assistant as entities:

- Lights will appear as light entities

- Scenes will appear as scene entities

You can control these entities through the Home Assistant UI, automations, scripts, and services.

### Example YAML Configuration

```yaml
# Example automation to turn on a Crestron light
automation:
  - alias: "Turn on Crestron light at sunset"
    trigger:
      platform: sun
      event: sunset
    action:
      service: light.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: light.living_room_main_light

# Example automation to activate a Crestron scene
automation:
  - alias: "Activate Movie Scene when media player starts"
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: media_player.living_room_tv
      to: "playing"
    action:
      service: scene.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: scene.living_room_movie
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Ensure your Crestron Home processor is reachable from your Home Assistant instance
- Verify that the Web API is enabled in the Crestron Home Setup app
- Check that the API token is valid and has not expired
- Verify that the correct host/IP is configured

### Missing Devices

- Make sure the device types you want to control are selected in the integration configuration
- Verify that the devices are properly configured in your Crestron Home system
- Try increasing the update interval to ensure all devices are discovered

### Enabling Debug Logging

To get more detailed information about what's happening with the integration, you can enable debug logging:

1. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.crestron_home: debug
```

2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Check the logs for detailed information about device discovery and communication with the Crestron system

The debug logs will show:
- Which device types are enabled
- How many devices are found in each category
- Which devices are being added to Home Assistant and which are being skipped
- Any errors that occur during communication with the Crestron system
